# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We support the latest version of RIDE.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in RIDE, please report it by creating an issue in our GitHub repository or contacting the maintainer directly.

Since RIDE is based on VS Code, vulnerabilities in the core editor should likely be reported to Microsoft via the [MSRC](https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report).

## Security Updates
We aim to merge upstream changes from VS Code regularly to ensure RIDE receives the latest security patches.
